About
======================================================

Subutai
-------

**Subutai Social is:**

* Data Center Management
* Container cloud orchestration
* Resource sharing and monetization
* and more...

Subutai Social Console allows you to manage your own containerized data center easily. 
All you need to do is to install our custom operating system `subos <https://github.com/subutai-io/subos>`_ on each of your bare-metal servers and install Subutai Social (**management container**) on one of them. 
Then you need to approve registration requests from all the rest servers in Management Console UI. 
After this, you can create container clouds (**Subutai environments**) across your servers via Subutai Console. 
Containers within an environment get connected to each other via an overlay `p2p <https://github.com/subutai-io/p2p>`_ network. 
Our `desktop tray <https://github.com/subutai-io/tray>`_ app provides you with an easy ssh access to the internals of your environment. 
You can use our handy `plugins <https://github.com/subutai-io/plugins>`_ to manage clustered applications such as big-data products like Hadoop or Cassandra. Moreover, you can peer your Subutai with another remote Subutai and use its resources or share yours with it. And, finally, the yummiest in the end, you can sell your data center resources and buy someone's resources ( or share resources on a free basis ) via our Subutai Social Hub.

Get started with our `installers <https://subutai.io/installation.html>`_ now.

Enjoy!
